excerpt: 'We investigate the question of whether facial metrology can be exploited for reliable gender prediction. A new method based solely on metrological information from facial landmarks is developed. Here, metrological features are defined in terms of specially normalized angle and distance measures and computed based on given landmarks on facial images.'

We investigate the question of whether facial metrology can be exploited for reliable gender prediction. A new method based solely on metrological information from facial landmarks is developed. Here, metrological features are defined in terms of specially normalized angle and distance measures and computed based on given landmarks on facial images. The performance of the proposed metrology-based method is compared with that of a state-of-the-art appearance-based method for gender classification. Results are reported on two standard face databases, namely, MUCT and XM2VTS containing 276 and 295 images, respectively. The performance of the metrology-based approach was slightly lower than that of the appearance-based method by only about 3.8% for the MUCT database and about 5.7% for the XM2VTS database.
