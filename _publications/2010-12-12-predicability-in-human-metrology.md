excerpt: 'Human metrology provides an important soft bio-metric, which can be used in challenging situations such as human identification at a distance, when traditional biometric traits such as fingerprints or iris cannot be easily acquired. We study the problem of predictability and correlation in human metrology, using the tools of uncertainty and differential entropy.'
